<div class="page_title">Vampire's Lair</div>
<div class="page_description">
I previously wrote an essay on the historical relationship between
written prose and illustration, and used gothic and superstitious
literature and artistry as a contextual example. This essay was
featured on a fold-out poster zine, and this illustration was printed
on the back of it.</div>
<div class="page_description">
Narrative illustration, especially when exploring topics such as
vampirism and other macabre elements, have always interested me
as they root back to the concept of 'death' and what it means in
different cultures and contexts to explore mortality, something that
all humans are destined to succumb to - grotesquely speaking!</div>
<div class="page_description">
I believe the fear of death is completely rational, as we can only
philosophise what happens to our consciousness after we die, but
the beautiful media and literature humanity has created surrounding
the topic of mortality is something that will still be cultivated for
many more centuries to come. Our current existence is a mere
fraction in the grand scheme of the universe, but our experiences
will be discussed by future generations of explorative minds.</div>
<div class="page_description">
I explored the concept of 'symbolism' in my essay and how many
religious and cultural symbols have been diversified and
transformed into modern media to visually support a text. This
illustration explores a lot of classic horror iconography to support
my essay.</div>
