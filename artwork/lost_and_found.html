<div class="page_title">Lost and Found</div>
<div class="page_description">
This project was part of a group exhibition which was titled 'Lost
and Found' That was held for one night at Secret Space in Digbeth,
Birmingham.</div>
<div class="page_description">
This was a personal piece exploring my relationship with being a
queer identity, specifically as a transgender person, in an
exploitative capitalistic world that benefits from my joy and passion
being taken away from my own relationship with my identity.</div>
<div class="page_description">
Personally for me, I feel as though my experience being
transgender is deeply spiritual and emotional. When society and the
carnage of politics take me at face-value, I feel myself gravitating
towards the opulence and wonder of nature and the universe.</div>
<div class="page_description">
Humanity has so many wondrous and beautiful methods of
attempting to analyse mystery and existence, whether it be through
cultural rituals, religion or folklore. Capitalism and colonialism has
ultimately tainted human connectivity and joy as a weapon of
control and establishment of patriarchal values where gender
diversity challenges the status quo.</div>
<div class="page_description">
I myself am very connected to celtic pagan practices and beliefs,
since my connection to the power of nature and the universe has
gotten me through a lot of difficult experiences. Self-care and
protection of the body and mind are especially important practices
to me as a transgender person, when the exclusion of my identity is
capitalised off of in the current political climate. I always try to live
by the quote 'joy is resistance' because fear curses us with
stagnation and surrender. Queer culture and connectivity will never
surrender. That's a revolution within itself.</div>
