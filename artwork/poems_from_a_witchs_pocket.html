<div class="page_title">Poems from a Witch's Pocket - Personal Project</div>
<div class="page_description">This Project is a collection of illustrated poems inspired by the
children's poetry book: 'Poems From A Witch's Pocket' by Laura
Theis. Witchcraft and folklore are topics I'm very interested in and I
chose the route of exploring pagan imagery to tie into the whimsical
witchy theme. This was a live brief with The Emma Press, so I was
given specific instructions to illustrate the cover in colour and the
internal illustrations in black and white.</div>

<b>"Poems From A Witch's Pocket Front Cover"</b> - My idea for the front cover was to illustrate the outside of the witch's
cottage. I envisioned her to live in an enchanted forest that is
abundant with flowers, mushrooms and woodland creatures. The
pages of her poems are scattered amongst the grass.

<b>"The Faraway Siblings"</b> - I've always loved the embodiment of the moon being a feminine,
almost sisterly entity. Instead of drawing the moon as a circle or
crescent in the sky, I wanted to draw her as a figure with a cloak
made of stars. From a personal perspective, I always feel
'protected' by the moon - I wanted this illustration to almost feel safe
and intimate.

		<div class="piece_description">
<b>"I Complain To My Friend Who Has Been Turned Into A Tree"</b> - For this illustration, I was heavily inspired by 'The Green Man' which
is a pagan symbol of rebirth. I came up with the idea of drawing the
witch's friend as a willow tree, with the branches flowing downwards
to embody the hair of a woman.

I started this project with very rough sketches of 'witchy' imagery to
cultivate a sense of style for my illustrations. A lot of these sketches
involve nature, animal familiars and imagery mentioned in the
poems.
