<div class="page_title">Folktale Prompt: "Night"</div>
<div class="page_description">
A lonely wolf howls into the velvet night. "Oh mother moon," he melodically cries "Life in the forest tires me, overwhelms me! If only there was some sort of magic that could run through the earth and travel up into my paws... Perhaps magic will take me away from here!"
</div>
<div class="page_description">
"Oh my child," The moon whispers back in a warm, silky tone. "There's magic all around you. You are the magic!"
</div>
<div class="page_description">
This is a singular-image narrative illustration based on Folktale Week's prompt: "Night".

<div class="page_description">
I always associate the night with the moon and wolves, so I illustrated an illuminated forest and mountaintop with a lonely wolf howling to a full moon. I wanted this piece to feel magical with a glowing, aura-like colour palette with soft textures to mimic the moonlight flooding along the trees and grass.
